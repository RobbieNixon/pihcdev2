testimonials:
  - quote: I've known Patience for many years. She took care of my mom in her later
      years and became a friend of mine.  You couldn't be in better hands than
      with Patience.
    author: "- Pam from Alexandria"
  - quote: Patience took care of my father that was in late stages of ALS until his
      last breaths.  She would rub his back and hold his hand to make him as
      comfortable as possible throughout. Our family is forever grateful.
    author: "- Cassandra from Rogers"
  - quote: Patience showed up with a smile on her face every day and a big heart to
      care for my grandson. When thing seemed dark, she was the light for
      him.  Until his last days he would greet Patience with his biggest
      smile.  He looked forward to hearing her knock-knock jokes and riddles.  I
      can hear him asking 'what goes up when the rain comes down?'. We are
      grateful.
