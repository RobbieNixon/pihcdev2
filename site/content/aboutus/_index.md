    text: >
      At Patience In Home Care (PIHC),  we know we are only as good as our
      employees.  We recognize that some larger health care companies in the
      area have lost sight of engaging, appreciating and rewarding strong work
      by their Nurses and PCA's. At PIHC, part of our foundation is regularly
      engaging our team to learn from them, know where they are at, and
      continuously improve our organization and enable our employees to thrive
      and grow with us!

  - heading: Appreciation for Our Clients
    text: At PIHC, we are never content until your loved ones are.  We know our best
      referrals and our reputation count on those in our care and we will
      actively engage them to hear their ideas and continuously improve our
      services for them.  We hope to expand services to provide new ways to
      entertain and engage our clients as we grow and allow our clients to drive
      what they need and want most.
